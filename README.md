# maternal_health_dashboard
This project is a data visualization dashboard that explores global and regional trends in maternal mortality, prenatal care access, and birth outcomes. Built using Tableau, the goal is to highlight disparities across demographics and geography, and to encourage data-driven discussion around maternal health equity.
